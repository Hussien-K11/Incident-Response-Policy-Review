# Incident Response Policy Review & Simulation

## 1. Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world task commonly assigned to junior SOC Analysts: reviewing and evaluating an organisationâ€™s Incident Response Policy (IRP). The purpose is to assess the strengths and limitations of the policy and test how it performs when applied to a realistic cyber incident scenario.

By working through this project, I aim to:

- Understand how incident response documentation supports security operations
- Identify potential policy gaps that could delay or hinder response
- Practise simulating incident handling using a simplified phishing scenario
- Strengthen my ability to think like a Tier 1 SOC Analyst

This project is part of my cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate analytical skills, documentation clarity, and readiness for real-world SOC environments.
