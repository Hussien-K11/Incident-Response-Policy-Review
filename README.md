## ➀ Project Overview

This project simulates a task commonly assigned to entry-level SOC Analysts: reviewing an organisation’s Incident Response Policy (IRP) and evaluating its effectiveness in guiding real-time incident response.

The focus is not only on identifying policy gaps, but also on applying the policy to a simulated phishing alert to assess whether the documented procedures hold up under realistic conditions.

## ➁ Real-World Objectives

This project is designed to build practical SOC skills in policy literacy, documentation analysis, and incident handling simulation. Specific objectives include:

- Understanding the structure and function of an IR policy
- Identifying strengths and weaknesses through structured review
- Simulating a common phishing scenario and walking through response phases
- Suggesting improvements based on observed limitations
- Practising clear documentation, critical thinking, and post-incident reflection

> **Analyst Note:**  
<<<<<<< HEAD
> This project was created to mirror the type of review and response task a new SOC analyst might perform during onboarding. It challenges me to not only understand policy documentation, but to think critically about how it translates into action — and whether it holds up during high-pressure incidents.
